- https://dvc.org/doc/command-reference/init
- "dvc add" before "dvc run" can cause problems
- Using pipelining tools like DVC/Snakemake help motivate good file organization

### Running dvc run
dvc run -n <stage-name> -d <script-path> -d <data-path> -o <output-paths> <command>

N.B dvc run deletes the output files/folders if the command fails

## Replit

  - Sometimes replit hangs, but refreshing the page works.
  - Displaying large amounts of data in the replit editor can crash plugins.


## Things to check

 - Does DVC delete the files before downloading them?
